- 👋 Hi, I’m @KlasJoar
- 👀 I’m interested in data science applied in industrial manufacturing.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the course path Data Science with Python at Dataquest, to be finished ~~this summer~~ during Autumn.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate for the moment. I prefer to wait until I've learnt some more basics.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'd probably prefer if you can't, for the moment.
